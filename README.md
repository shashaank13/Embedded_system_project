# Embedded_system_project
Embedded systems are widely used in many home appliances and automation systems. It is 
used in many areas, some examples are Central heating systems, GPS systems, Fitness trackers,
medical devices and Automotive systems. If they are able to provide the knowledge on the 
status of the electronic appliances in home, they will improve the overall experience of the 
users and provide them convenience. Embedded systems can also improve security by having 
password to activate the systems. Our project has both security (password authentication) and 
provide the user with the knowledge on the status of the application (displayed through a 
Bluetooth device).
