# Embedded_system_project
Embedded systems are widely used in many home appliances and automation systems. It is 
used in many areas, some examples are Central heating systems, GPS systems, Fitness trackers,
medical devices and Automotive systems. If they are able to provide the knowledge on the 
status of the electronic appliances in home, they will improve the overall experience of the 
users and provide them convenience. Embedded systems can also improve security by having 
password to activate the systems. Our project has both security (password authentication) and 
provide the user with the knowledge on the status of the application (displayed through a 
Bluetooth device).In this project an embedded system which can be used to turn the lights on different floors and off 
them on authentication and view the status of the floor lights using a Bluetooth application on 
mobile phone. User’s floor id and Password has to be given to turn on and off the lights on the 
floor and to turn them off. The lights can be turned on and off in any order. The status of the 
lights will be displayed to the user using a Bluetooth application that is connected with the 
embedded system’s Arduino board using a Bluetooth module. The user can also see the real 
time at which the light at any floor is turned on and the time at which it is turned off using the 
Bluetooth application.
